# Sample Data for Benchmarks

This files are used by the benchmark suite and passed to the Node.js applications.
This folder contains sample media files and an empty ghost application. Ghost has a lot of dependencies and therefore it has an huge file structure with more than 400 files.

Then benchmarks are always using all files inside sample-data so you can change the content of this folder if you want to use other files.
